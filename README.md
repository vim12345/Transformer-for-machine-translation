# Transformer-for-machine-translation
# Description:
The Transformer model introduced by Vaswani et al. revolutionized machine translation by relying entirely on attention mechanisms. In this project, we use a pre-trained Transformer model from Hugging Face (like T5 or MarianMT) to translate text from one language to another (e.g., English to French, German, Spanish, etc.).

# ðŸ§  What This Project Demonstrates:
* Uses pre-trained Transformer-based MarianMT model for translation

* Handles tokenization, model inference, and decoding in a few lines

* Can translate between hundreds of language pairs
